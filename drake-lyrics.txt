 Introduced as a subtle rejoinder to Twitter's obligate 'hearting' innovation (in case it seems merely gratuitously gross).
 Be good so see some equivalent high-quality data on the topic.
 ...So, a long way short of a plurality, but (hugely) "disproportionate" Ashkenazi cognitive slack isn't sensibly disputable.
 "...they made up about 3% of the US population but won 27% of the US Nobel science prizes ..." 
   The "just" there is silly: 

 ...Normie genetics, non-autistic socialization, and child-rearing munches through mental slack like freaking Pacman.
 Free cognitive potential in general is "disproportionately gay and jewish" -- like it or hate it, that's simply a fact.
 ...It has better Mal-AI game.
 My money's on the hyena.
""Moldbug is totally Alt-Right."
"Give me a break."
"Why would we do that? You're ripping our fucking throat out."
"Fair enough.""
 Communism is the plan to reduce global entropy, which tells us everything we need to know about its prospects.
..."He's going to say 'nothing' isn't he? OMG he's going to say 'nothing'. This is beyond belief ..." No he isn't, and doesn't, you morons.
It's truly amazing how the camp of outrage has fixated upon MM's 'particularly inflammatory question' â€œWhat's so bad about the Nazis?â€ ...
...That's the only sense in which Moldbug is plausibly "aligned with the alt-right" He rejects Left Hegemony too.
...rather than anything with intrinsic specificity. It's meaning is the sudden, drastic loss of their effective moral authority. ...
Decoder tip: When the Left use the term "Alt-Right" it's a tribal abbreviation for "the incomprehensible nightmare that's happened to us" ..
  If the Left succeeds in bolting together that "free speech = fascism" formula it seems so attached to, then maybe.
 ..."Intelligence, in other words, is political." -- At least, it's what politics has been directed to stop.
 Dimness is a zealous political cause for these people. Thank Gnon, Chinese competition has rendered it non-viable.
 Seen that a while back. It's superb.
So Milo's social conservatism turned out to be a little flakier than everyone had expected.
  Associated with a 10 pt IQ gain (!) according to Thompson in the comments.
Greenspan: Yeah, actually Ron Paul was right. 
"RealClear Reality Divergence intensifies:

 I'm not criticizing the basic argument of the article in the slightest -- only its predictable swerve into partisan smugness.
 Perish the thought that the establishment would ever take the opportunity to critically examine their own dogmas.
People aren't very rational, especially people journalists don't like:

All political problems are badly-sorted social aggregates.
  ...Same goes for every other variant of ideological possibility, including many yet to be clearly formulated.
  ...Communists anywhere who aren't busy doing communism (in their own patch) are a wasted educational opportunity. ...
  For pretty much any "Do we do A or B?" socio-political question, there's plenty of geography to do both.
 Easier, because it's not primarily racial separation that is at stake, but regime diversity (inc. differential ethnonationalism).
 Absolute epistemological fission has now occurred: 
Dysgenic darkness: 
  No, he (still) thinks it's highly exaggerated.
   Best way to defeat eugenics is to extirpate that entire dodgy germ-line.
 Garbage-disposal is always under-rated. 
   Don't miss the opportunity to push him through a Malthusian bottle-neck.

 Except the more they win, the faster things fall apart. The Left think they can win a war against Gnon. Dark comedy.
"Right-Accelerationism" -- the new "Neoliberalism"? 
...The Rubicon has been crossed. There's no rescinding the death sentence. The only question now concerns a competent executioner.

 They're still going to hurt a lot of people as they fall down the staircase.
 The Friedman dynasty keeps heading deeper into freedom territory after Milton.
  Pan out from Lukacs to the Lukacs promotion operation, and it becomes more plausible.
 The fact that the Progressive Media smugly consider themselves the sole living embodiment of the 1A says everything.
White Cathedral-zombies spitting bile from behind the burkhas of black people is 90% of the phenomenon.
..."When they're smart and polite" would have done fine, but then the snarling Jacobinism behind the remark would have been too obvious.
..."He likes Asians because they are deemed to be smart and polite ..." -- the 'deemed' there is golden. ...
...just not the grievance-mongers, rioters, street-criminals, and Jihadists that the Cathedral preaches incessantly in favor of.
"Actually, I like plenty of "immigrants and black people"

  If you were the source of a "watching where you're going" gene I seriously doubt you'd be showing up in my Twitter TL.

   Less manorialism-tweaked outbreeder genes, less Scottish Enlightenment, more Rousseauistic evil.
 The notion that late-19th century (white) immigration didn't move the US massively leftwards is absurdly unobservant.

..."...That may sound grandiose, but to my mind, the comparison actually underplays the depth and the rapidity of the transformation."
"Historians liken the rise of social media to the invention of the printing press. ..." 

 Saying "I was just moralizing" doesn't excuse totalitarian leftism.
"Weâ€™re a well-oiled machine. We got one of the smoothest running machines in the history of machines." 
  Oh sure, AI Communism is totally going to work next time.

 It will toughen everyone up.

...Reason does a pretty good work-over of Jones' howl from the id: 
Kek: 
  Nothing an author hates more than people buying stacks of their books and burning them.
..."Trump wins by convulsing time-topology to induce intensifying retrochronic waves -- resist by mumbling and falling over more."
